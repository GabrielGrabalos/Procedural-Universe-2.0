# 🌌 Procedural Universe 2.0

🪐 Welcome to the **Procedural Universe** project! This repository contains a **procedurally generated universe** built using **HTML5 Canvas**. In this project, you can explore an **infinite universe**, filled with countless stars. When you click on a star, it zooms into that star's system, where you can see its planets and even their moons. 

🚀 The project was built using a custom **game management system**, with classes like **Game**, **Scene**, **GameObject**, and more. This flexible structure allows for easy expansion as new features are added.

✍️ This project is a recreation of a recreation of a project similar to this one. I love the idea of creating my own infinite universe, so I try to improve it every time I feel like I've evolved my coding skills.

## 🌟 Current Features

- 🌌 **Infinite Pannable Universe**: Explore an endless starfield by dragging the canvas.
- ✨ **Procedural Generation**: Each star has its own solar system, complete with **planets** and **moons**, all generated on the fly.
- 🖱️ **Interactive Stars**: Click on any star to zoom in and reveal its planetary system.
- 🧩 **Custom Game Management System**:
  - **Game Class**: Manages the entire universe.
  - **Scene Class**: Handles switching between the starfield, planetary systems, and other scenes.
  - **GameObject Class**: Base class for all celestial bodies (stars, planets, moons, etc.).

## 🔭 Future Features

This project is still in development, and many exciting features will be added in future updates!

### 🖼️ UI (Within the Canvas)
- 🖥️ A **user interface** will be added directly into the canvas to provide information about celestial bodies, game settings, and navigation options.
- 🔧 The UI will also allow interaction with game objects and navigation between different systems.

### 🎬 Animation System
- 🎞️ A custom **animation system** will be introduced to animate various objects like planets and moons.
- 🎥 The **camera** will be animated to smoothly transition between different celestial objects, zoom in and out, and move across the universe.

### 🗺️ Explorable Map
- 🗺️ When a celestial body (planet, moon, etc.) is clicked, an **explorable map** will be generated. You will be able to zoom in further and explore the surface of planets or moons.

### 🌠 More Celestial Body Types
- 🌟 Additional types of celestial bodies will be introduced, such as:
  - 🪐 **Gas Giants**
  - ☄️ **Comets**
  - 🌌 **Black Holes**
  - 🌟 **Nebulae**

### 💫 Planetary Rings
- 🪐 Some planets will feature **rings** similar to Saturn's, with dynamic rendering and animation.

### 🎨 Textures for Celestial Bodies
- 🌍 Celestial bodies will no longer be simple circles! We will add **textures** for planets, moons, and stars to create more realistic and visually appealing objects.

### 🎮 Gamification
- 🏆 Over time, the game will evolve to include gameplay elements:
  - 📊 **Resources**: Celestial bodies might contain resources to collect.
  - 🚀 **Exploration Missions**: Players can send probes or spaceships to explore further.
  - 🔧 **Upgrades**: Earn resources to upgrade your exploration tools or unlock new features.

## 💡 Other Planned Features

- 🌕 **Moon Phases**: Add realistic moon phases depending on the planet's position relative to its star.
- 🪙 **Economy System**: Add in-game currency and trade routes between planets.
- ⚙️ **Modularity**: Extend the game manager to easily allow for modding and user-generated content.
